    "**Title**: Analyzing Employee Salaries in San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"Imagine you're the head of HR for the city of San Francisco. You’ve been handed a massive dataset containing details of employee salaries and benefits across various departments. Your goal is to understand how the city compensates its employees, identify any patterns or anomalies in the data, and use these insights to make informed decisions regarding compensation policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, are certain departments over-relying on overtime pay? Are there disparities in base pay across different job titles? By the end of this analysis, we hope to answer these questions and provide actionable insights for optimizing the city's compensation strategy.\"\n",

    "**Slide 2: Exploring the Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title**: Getting to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"Before we dive into the analysis, let's take a closer look at the data we're working with. The dataset includes columns such as `EmployeeName`, `JobTitle`, `BasePay`, `OvertimePay`, `Benefits`, and `TotalPay`. By understanding the structure of our data, we can better navigate the cleaning and analysis process.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Show the first few rows of the dataset to give a concrete example.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\"We see that the dataset is well-structured, but we immediately notice potential issues like missing values in the `Benefits` column and the presence of redundant information in columns like `Notes` and `Status`, which appear largely irrelevant for our analysis.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slide 3: Identifying Data Issues**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title**: Cleaning Up the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"Data cleaning is an essential step before we can perform any meaningful analysis. We found that several columns have missing data, especially in `Benefits`, where over 36,000 records are incomplete. Additionally, we noticed that the `Notes` and `Status` columns have excessive missing values and don’t add value to our analysis, so we decided to drop them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remaining columns with missing data (`BasePay`, `OvertimePay`, `OtherPay`), we filled these gaps with the median of each column to maintain consistency across our dataset.\"\n",

    "**Slide 4: Understanding Salary Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Title**: What Does the Salary Data Tell Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"With the data cleaned, we now turn our attention to understanding the distribution of salaries across the city’s workforce. We start by looking at `BasePay`, which is the core salary component for all employees. A histogram shows that the majority of employees earn between $50,000 and $100,000, but there are outliers with base pay significantly higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then examine `OvertimePay` and `OtherPay`. Interestingly, while most employees receive little to no overtime, a small group has very high overtime pay, which may indicate an over-reliance on overtime work in certain departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `Benefits` distribution highlights that while many employees receive substantial benefits, this component varies widely, raising questions about how benefits are allocated.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Title**: Exploring Relationships Between Salary Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"Next, we explore the relationships between different components of compensation to understand how they interact. By calculating the correlation matrix, we can see that `BasePay` is strongly correlated with `TotalPay` and `TotalPayBenefits`, which is expected as it’s the largest component of an employee’s pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there’s also a moderate correlation between `OvertimePay` and `TotalPay`, suggesting that in some cases, overtime significantly boosts an employee’s overall compensation. This insight could be crucial for the city’s budgeting and overtime policies, indicating departments where overtime is heavily used.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Narrative**:\n",
    "\"From our analysis, a few key insights emerge:\n",
    "1. **Disparities in Base Pay**: While most employees fall within a standard pay range, outliers with extremely high base pay warrant further investigation.\n",
    "2. **Overtime Usage**: The reliance on overtime in certain departments could indicate staffing issues or the need for better workload distribution.\n",
    "3. **Benefits Distribution**: The wide variation in benefits suggests inconsistencies in how these are allocated, potentially leading to inequalities among employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings can help inform policies that aim to make employee compensation more equitable and efficient across the city.\"\n",

    "\"To wrap up, our analysis of San Francisco's employee salary data has provided valuable insights into how the city compensates its workforce. By addressing the disparities and inefficiencies highlighted in this analysis, the city can optimize its compensation strategy, ensure fair pay across departments, and better manage its budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a next step, further analysis could focus on specific departments or roles to drill down into the factors driving high overtime or benefits allocation, and to explore potential cost-saving measures without compromising employee satisfaction.\"\n",
